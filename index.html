    <p>
      I love learning out loud and building things that are creative solutions and intuitive.

      I was a student at Tulane University in New Orleans. Where I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, Psychology, and Sociology. My personal passion lies at the intersection of development and design.
